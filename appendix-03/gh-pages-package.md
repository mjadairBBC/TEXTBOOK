# `gh-pages` package

If you want to deploy a React app to Github Pages, the easiest solution is to use the `gh-pages` package.

## Setup

1. Install the `gh-pages` package with `npm` or `yarn`

  ```
  npm i gh-pages
  ```
  ```
  yarn add gh-pages
  ```

1. Add a `build` script in your `package.json`

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack -p"
  }
  ```

1. Add a `deploy` script. This need to first run the build task, then use the `gh-pages` package to deploy the code. The `-d` flag indicates the folder to deploy. This should be the folder generated by the build task _usually `dist` or `public`_

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wepback -p",
    "deploy": "yarn build && gh-pages -d dist"
  }
  ```

The code should now build and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch.
